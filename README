# Database Scripts for Sprocket

Simply put, the normal operation of our hosted Sprocket instance in service of
MLE, we have to do certain bit of updating the database each season to prepare
for the next season's events: things like intent forms, creating season
schedules, and creating matches for the playoffs as they progress. This set of
scripts does each of those things listed, and a few others. 

## Creating Matches
To create the appropriate data rows for match scheduling during the season,
Sprocket requires quite a few entries. 

### MLEDB Side

- Entities
    - Season
    - Match
    - Fixture
    - Series
- Relationships
    - A season contains matches (10 per season).
    - Each match contains fixtures, one per pair of teams.
    - Each fixture contains up to 10 series, one per game mode and league/skill group that the
      pair of teams has and is playing.

### Sprocket Side

- Entities
    - Schedule Group
    - Schedule Fixture
    - Match Parent
    - Match
- Relationships
    - A schedule group can be a season or a phase of a season, and contain other
      schedule groups.
        - So, we have an SG for season 17, as well as for each week of season 17.
    - A schedule group contains zero or more schedule fixtures, one for each
      pair of teams.
    - A schedule fixture contains up to 10 match parents, one per game mode and
      skill group combo
    - Each match parent contains one match. The match parent is a
      Sprocket-schema-only device we use to distinguish between scrims, matches,
      and events, each of which gets the same data stuffed into a match entity. 

## Prerequisites
The process to create matches begins with a schedule from MLE League Ops. This
will generally consist of a csv with fields like Match/Week Number, Start
Date, End Date, Home Team, Away Team, and which Leagues/Skill Groups play. The
script `convertInputs.py` is an example of how one might take the 'master
schedule' from LO and parse it into the various pieces we need. In particular,
the `createSeasonSchedule.py` script requires four thing to be done before it
can run successfully:

### MLEDB Season and Matches
Matches need a season, match number, start datetime, and end datetime. Upload via CSV or
create manually. 

### Sprocket Schedule Groups
One for the season, and one for each phase of the season (week number or playoff
round). Upload via CSV or create manually. 

### A Properly Formatted Input CSV
One row per *set of 5 rounds to be played*, termed a `match` in the Sprocket
schema and a `series` in MLEDB. Each of the form

(Gamemode, League, Match, Home, Away, Home Franchise ID, Away Franchise ID)

### Metadata for MLEDB Matches and Sprocket SGs
As preamble to `createSeasonSchedule.py`. You can find the format in that file.
